# Quadrilateral
This program determines the type of quadrilateral bouded by four lines.
Given the quotients of the equation of the line in standard form (ax + by = c),
program analyzes each line to determine what kind of shape is bounded by four lines.
Program is able to recognize five types of quadrilaterals: rectangle, square, rhombus,
parallelogram, and trapezoid.

where each line consist of the quotients of the equation of the line in standard form. Each group of four lines 
defines bounds a shape.
